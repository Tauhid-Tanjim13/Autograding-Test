st.write("""You will build a web application that helps Machine Learning Practitioners through an end-to-end ML pipeline.
    
    1. Explore and visualize the data to gain insights.
    2. Preprocess and prepare the data for machine learning algorithms.
    3. Select a model and train it. Fine-tune your model.
    4. Test Model.  Evaluate models using standard metrics.
    5. Deploy your application (present your solution). Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.
